## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/flashbots/suapp-examples.git

# Checkout the suave-geth submodule
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

---

## Compile the examples

Install [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/):

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

Compile:

```bash
forge build
```

---

## Start the local devnet

### TL;DR

1. Install prerequisites:

   - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
   - [Kurtosis](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install/)

2. Clone customised [kurtosis ethereum package](https://github.com/flashbots/kurtosis-ethereum-package)
   into the adjacent directory (`../kurtosis-ethereum-package`).

3. Run

    ```bash
    # Launch kurtosis devnet + sidecar docker-compose with SUAVE
    make devnet-up

    # Point SUAVE examples to the devnet
    export BUILDER_URL=http://el-4-geth-builder-lighthouse:8545
    export L1_PRIVKEY=bcdf20249abf0ed6d944c0288fad489e33f66b3960d9e6229c1cd214ed3bbe31

    # Run
    go run examples/app-ofa-private/main.go

    # Tear-down
    make devnet-down
    ```

>
> Notes:
>
> 1. If you are Mac OS user, you might want to consider using
>    [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) instead of Docker Desktop.
>
> 2. Some of the tests (`app-ofa-private`, for example) will need Eth
>    devnet to progress beyond dencun fork.  Wait out ~5m after the
>    start before running them.

### Details

Above setup will (among other things) deploy:

- SUAVE devnet RPC on `http://127.0.0.1:8545`
- Eth devnet RPC on `http://127.0.0.1:8545`
- SUAVE explorer on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
- Eth explorer on `http://127.0.0.1:18080`
- MEV Boost Relay Overview on `http://127.0.0.1:9060`

All Eth components are provisioned by `ethereum-package` from kurtosis.
Please check `https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/ethereum-package` for more info.
