# casino-client

A very basic slot machine SUAPP. Uses random numbers generated by the `randomBytes` precompile.

This example deploys the [Slots](./contracts/Slots.sol) contract to a local SUAVE devnet and spins a slot machine 100 times.

## instructions

See [the docs](https://suave-alpha.flashbots.net/tutorials/run-suave) for instructions to spin up a local devenet.

Install smart contract dependencies and build our contracts:

```bash
forge install
forge build
```

Install bun dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.16. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
