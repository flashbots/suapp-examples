# casino-client

A very basic slot machine SUAPP. Uses random numbers generated by the `randomBytes` precompile.

This example deploys the [Slots](./contracts/Slots.sol) contract to a local SUAVE devnet and spins a slot machine 100 times.

## instructions

First, install smart contract dependencies and build our contracts:

```bash
forge install
forge build
```

To install bun dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.16. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
