# Example Suapp with external calls to Uniswap V3

This example features how a Suapp can make an external call to the Uniswap V3 router deployed on the suave-enabled chain to request a quote.

To test this example, the Suave nodes needs to connect to the suave-enabled node with the `--suave.eth.remote_endpoint` flag.
