# Example Suapp with a stored private key generated by the Suapp

This is a variation of the [private-suapp-key](../private-suapp-key) example. The difference is that the private key is generated by the Suapp itself during the `initialize` function.

## How to use

Run `Suave` in development mode:

```
$ suave-geth --suave.dev
```

Execute the deployment script:

```
$ go run main.go
```
